3. Figure out what skill the player is using to activate birding
	3a. OR... find the birding skill, hook into its skill cooldown
	    Observation: Hobbies don't show up in the list of Trained Skills.
	    Need to fall back to detecting key-bind for the skill.

    Note:
        If we can also know which keys are activating Quickslot Page Up and Quickslot Page Down, 
        we can track which page the birding skill is on.
        Maybe add an options checkbox "My birding skill is on multiple quickslot pages"?

	If your have the plugin-recognized birding kit equipped and
		you are not in combat and
		you press the birding key then
			we should assume you birded.
		end

6. Show Birding proficiency on the UI so I don't have to look in my character/hobby screen.

7. Script to import Birding process from LOTRO Companion.

9. When printing a list of birds, have an option to sort by rarity.

10. Only pay attention to certain channels.

11. Improvement to Birding collections panel that allows to show just the birds in a region.

13. Use Regional chat channel changes to auto-detect what region we're in. (See Deed Tracker)
	The alias under Zone does this, need to make it bigger.
	(How do we hide the shortcut box?)

14. Add icon to open window.

15. Color the first 5 seconds of the timer differently because it is a mandatory skill cooldown?

16.
    Possible timer improvements:
        The final 3 seconds might not happen if you don't catch a bird? Test this!
        Try mis-birding at 10.1/10.2/10.3 seconds as a way of testing if 0-10 is the correct boundary for the first birding section.
        Whenever we bird or re-bird, place a 5? second block on top of the actual timer that also shrinks color-coded to show that we're on cooldown. (Same red?)
       	Add some way to cancel the birding timer, in case the player moves or something.

17. Localize all strings
