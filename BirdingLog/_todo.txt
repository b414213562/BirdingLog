6. Show Birding proficiency on the UI so I don't have to look in my character/hobby screen.

7. Script to import Birding process from LOTRO Companion.

9. When printing a list of birds, have an option to sort by rarity.

10. Only pay attention to certain channels.

11. Improvement to Birding collections panel that allows to show just the birds in a region.

13. Obscure the shortcut box under Set Zone

14. Add icon to open window.

15. Color the first 5 seconds of the timer differently because it is a mandatory skill cooldown?

16.
    Possible timer improvements:
        The final 3 seconds might not happen if you don't catch a bird? Test this!
        Try mis-birding at 10.1/10.2/10.3 seconds as a way of testing if 0-10 is the correct boundary for the first birding section.
        Whenever we bird or re-bird, place a 5? second block on top of the actual timer that also shrinks color-coded to show that we're on cooldown. (Same red?)
       	Add some way to cancel the birding timer, in case the player moves or something.

17. Localize all strings
